## Setup
Complete these steps on the Ansible Host that will run supreme-pancake.

1. SSH into the Ansible host
   ```bash
   $ ssh kazoo-ansible.lan

   ```
6. Edit site.yml (Hint: Press i for insert mode and Escape for command mode)
   ```bash
   $ cd ~/kazoo-ansible
   $ vi site.yml
   ```
7. Modify site.yml to add optional or custom roles
   ```yaml
   ---
   - hosts: all
     become: true
     roles:
     - kazoo-ansible.common
   
   - hosts: couchdb
     become: true
     roles:
     - kazoo-ansible.couchdb
     # Uncomment couchdb-google-storage-backup to add daily backup 
     # scripts to backup CouchDB to Google Cloud Storage
     # - kazoo-ansible.couchdb-google-storage-backup
   
   - hosts: rabbitmq
     become: true
     roles:
     - kazoo-ansible.rabbitmq
   
   - hosts: freeswitch
     become: true
     roles:
     - kazoo-ansible.freeswitch
   
   - hosts: kamailio
     become: true
     roles:
     - kazoo-ansible.kamailio
   
   - hosts: kazoo
     become: true
     roles:
     - kazoo-ansible.kazoo
   
   - hosts: monsterui
     become: true
     roles:
     - kazoo-ansible.monsterui
   
   - hosts: all
     become: true
     roles:
     - kazoo-ansible.updates
   ```
8. Save site.yml
   ```bash
   :wq<enter>
   ```
9. Edit group_vars/all (Hint: Press i for insert mode and Escape for command mode)
   ```bash
   $ cd ~/kazoo-ansible
   $ vi group_vars/all
   ```
10. Modify group_vars based on your cluster configuration
    ```yaml
    ---
    # The domain used to access Monster UI
    kazoo_domain: kazoo.lan
    
    # Enables Let's Encrypt. Set to no to manage TLS certificates manually
    kazoo_enable_lets_encrypt: yes
    
    # Usernames that can either be left alone or changed
    couch_user: couchdb
    rabbitmq_user: rabbitmq
    
    # Passwords and cookies that should definitely be changed
    erlang_cookie: changeme
    rabbitmq_password: changeme
    couch_password: changeme
    
    # Manually-managed TLS certificate to secure Crossbar and MonsterUI if 
    # Let's Encrypt is disabled
    kazoo_tls_certificate: |
      -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
      Your certificate here!
      -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    kazoo_tls_private_key: |
      -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
      Your private key here
      -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
    
    # CouchDB Google Cloud Storage Backup Settings
    # These settings are only required if the couchdb-google-storage-backup 
    # role is used
    couchdb_google_storage_backup_bucket_name: Your Google Cloud Storage bucket name here
    couchdb_google_storage_backup_service_account_key: |
      Your Google Cloud Service credentials.json contents here
    ```
11. Save group_vars
    ```bash
    :wq<enter>
    ```
12. SSH into each Kazoo node to cache the host in known_hosts
    ```bash
    $ ssh kazoo.lan
    The authenticity of host 'kazoo.lan (127.0.0.1)' can't be established.
    ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:JtNSVrHMsgGAdFoek0R15Gm0Pjczi3kMOTgNSic0dq4.
    ECDSA key fingerprint is MD5:6d:07:fc:a4:36:ac:89:23:5e:e6:a6:8d:1e:e6:fe:8d.
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
    Warning: Permanently added 'kazoo.lan' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
    Last login: Tue Oct 10 02:46:40 2017 from cnd4220hd2.lan
    $ logout
    ```
13. Bootstrap the Kazoo nodes
    ```bash
    # The bootstrap process assumes that all Kazoo nodes have the same 
    # password if SSH login is not possible and that sudo root access 
    # is available
    $ ansible-playbook bootstrap.yml --ask-pass --ask-become-pass
    SSH password: Your SSH password
    SUDO password[defaults to SSH password]: Your SSH password
    ```
## Running Playbook
1. SSH into the Ansible host
   ```bash
   $ ssh kazoo-ansible.lan
   ```
2. Run the kazoo-ansible Ansible Playbook
   ```bash
   $ cd ~/kazoo-ansible
   $ ansible-playbook site.yml
   ```

## Post Playbook Steps
1. SSH into one of the Kazoo nodes with the kazoo role
   ```bash
   $ ssh kazoo.lan
   ```
2. Import FreeSwitch Media
   ```bash
   # EN-US prompts
   $ sup kazoo_media_maintenance import_prompts /opt/kazoo/sounds/en/us/
   
   # Add additional prompts as needed
   # sup kazoo_media_maintenance import_prompts /opt/kazoo/sounds/fr/ca fr-ca
   ```
3. Create the Kazoo Master Administrator Account
   ```bash
   # Create an account with your own account name, realm, username, and password
   $ sup crossbar_maintenance create_account YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME YOUR_REALM YOUR_USERNAME YOUR_PASSWORD
   ```
4. Initialize MonsterUI Applications
   ```bash
   # Initialize MonsterUI using the Kazoo domain set in group_vars/all
   $ sup crossbar_maintenance init_apps /var/www/html/monster-ui/apps https://kazoo.lan/crossbar/v2
   ```
